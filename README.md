# dotfiles

Initial commit to my aweasome dotfiles configuration made possible to maintain (properly) with chezmoi!

## Installation

Coming soon..! (as I figure out how to do it properly with chezmoi ðŸ˜‚)

## Things to add

- [ ] Add a proper installation guide
- [ ] Add a proper way to install packages declaratively post installation with an `run_onchange_` prefix script
- [ ] Make sure the scripts are idempotent and can be run multiple times without breaking anything

## Thanks to

- [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) for making it possible to maintain my dotfiles configuration in a proper way.
- [JaKooLi](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland/tree/main) for the hyprland installation script that I totally re-used for my own needs (and modified a bit.. I admit! ðŸ˜Š) and also the dotfiles.
- [zDyanTB](https://github.com/zDyanTB/HyprNova) for the HyprNova dotfiles that I borrowed as a base for my own dotfiles. Many thanks! âœ¨
